#### Introductory statements
* Exoplanets
* LARGE amounts of data
* Difficulty of Modeling similar systems


#### The three datasets
* Kepler Confirmed Exoplanets - lots of granular detail about the systems, contains a lot of planetary and star measurements
* Kepler Objects of Interest - Confirmed, Candidate, and False Positive systems, provides analysis of what makes a likely candidate
* EU Exoplanet Catalog - Large catalog of confirmed planets, including Kepler systems. A good look at other detection types, and has more detail on estimated model parameters (planet temp, composition, etc).
* joins

#### Important Terms
* Built for both scientists and those completely new to exoplanets
* Some important terms: mass, semi-major axis (AUs), period









## System Look Up

#### Elements of the Dash
* What are useful metrics for systems
* Why some have more data than others

## Comparison System

Main tool for curious amateur astronomers, be able to compare your candidate system, drill into existing discoveries, and make insights about if you have a planet or not!


## Intersting Notes
- Variable names are stored in unhelpfully short snippets, for instance st_pmdec instead of Dec Proper Motion. Because sql is generated in looker, I can give descriptive field names
- Same dash can be used for amateurs and experts, just fill in what you know!
